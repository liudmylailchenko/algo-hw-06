# DFS vs BFS Path Comparison

## Graph Structure
The given graph consists of the following edges:

```
[('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'D'), ('C', 'E'), ('D', 'F'), ('E', 'F'), ('F', 'G'), ('G', 'H'), ('H', 'I'), ('I', 'J')]
```

## DFS Result
Depth-First Search (DFS) Path:
```
['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'J', 'H', 'F']
```

## BFS Result
Breadth-First Search (BFS) Path:
```
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
```

## Comparison and Explanation

- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - This often results in a deeper but not necessarily the shortest path.
  - In this case, DFS goes deep into the graph first, potentially reaching the goal via a longer route.

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving to the next level.
  - This guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.
  - BFS systematically visits all nodes layer by layer and finds the shortest path to `F`.

As seen from the paths:
- DFS might take a longer or unexpected path due to its depth-first nature.
- BFS provides the shortest path from `A` to `F`.
